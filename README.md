### Website Built from Web-Template, kindly provided by GA Boston.



### Save Us From Design!
We highly recommend you use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/), [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/css.html) to aid with
the design of your portfolio. Choose one, and start adding features to your site!
This doesn't mean you can't change in the future, but do some research and pick
which ever one you like best!

## A Quick Note on Technology

As you may know by now, in WDI we'll use [browser-template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/browser-template) to create
web apps. However, since these portfolios typically won't have the same
robust functionality, we've included simple index.html, index.js, and main.css
files to get started without the added complexity of a webpack build.
